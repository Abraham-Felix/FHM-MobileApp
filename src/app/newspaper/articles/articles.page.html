      <p class="paragraph-4"><strong>Elementus</strong>, a New York City-based startup whose protocol provides block-level insight on most public blockchains, including on the amount of a token held and its ownership, prefers traditional venture financing to a security token offering (STO), CEO and founder Max Galka told this news service. Elementus executives <a href="http://fintechhorizonsmedia.com/articles?id=84" target="_blank">told FHM</a> in November that an STO was an option. This week, Galka told FHM that an STO is not currently under consideration. The CEO cited growing venture interest in the space and the difficult environment for STOs as reasons the company was no longer considering one. An ICO has never been an option,  Galka said in an FHM article in November. Elementus does not have an interest in creating a utility token if there is not a compelling reason to do so, he said.While Elementus software analyzes public blockchains, its platform uses a traditional software-as-a-service model. <br><br>The software collects raw data on public blockchains and then packages that data in a useful way, the CEO said. The data it collects includes details about a token held in a specific block, as well as details about the blockchain as a whole, according to the company.Elementus rolled out its beta to select users in November. The company is still in the midst of its beta but is starting to form strategic partnerships with companies and organizations who took part in its initial rollout. Building strategic partnerships is a top priority for the remainder of 2019, as is hiring smart, motivated people to add to its team, Galka said.<br><br>‍<strong>DLT compliance heats up: </strong>Elementus was founded in 2017 and had raised about $800,000, as of November 2018.Galka declined to offer specifics on its current fundraising, but he said there is a growing interest among investors in blockchain intel and compliance.<br><br>Already this year, several blockchain intel/compliance startups have raised new funding including Chainalysis ($36m), CipherTrace, ($15m ) Solidus Labs ($3.5m) and Digital Assets Data ($3.2m).The growing venture interest in the space is positive. A company like Solidus Labs, for example, looks at market data to find evidence of price manipulation, while Elementus focuses on decoding block-level data. There are plenty of use cases for all distributed ledger technology (DLT) intel startups to tackle. All available solutions are necessary to remove bad actors. The industry is still immature, and not enough attention has been paid to compliance. Until bad actors are eliminated, it will not be possible for crypto to gain mainstream acceptance, Galka said.<br><br>While people dislike the analogy, blockchain intel technology can play a similar role to what search engine technology did for the Internet. Just as search engines enabled the Internet to flourish, blockchain intelligence/compliance technology can serve as the fundamental piece that can make the whole system work, he said.<br><br>‍<strong>Decoding hacks: </strong>There is a misconception that blockchain is something dark and magical, but the reality is really the opposite. Blockchains are public databases and it is possible to learn a great deal about what they contain, while still respecting individual privacy, he said.  Galka and Elementus have been cited in several publications for their work that traces the movement of funds between exchanges during recent hacks. Galka’s blog provides breakdowns of some of these hacks/situations including on Cryptopia, CoinBene, and Tether. <br><br>‍<strong>Other use cases: </strong>In the interview with FHM in November, Galka outlined other potential uses for Elementus software. Among uses mentioned include analyzing the accuracy of publicly disclosed information on token offerings, providing due diligence for evaluating venture investments, and providing insights to banks, hedge funds, traders and security professionals.Before founding Elementus, Galka worked at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. He is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and holds degrees in finance and computer science.</p>
